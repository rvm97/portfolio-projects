## Overview

The **Medanova Salesforce Analytics Accelerator** is a modular, enterprise-grade BI dashboard designed to enhance visibility into contract performance, renewal behavior, sales rep effectiveness, and partner contribution.

Built using **SQL Server** and **Power BI**, the accelerator introduces original metrics such as:

- **IQRR (Intelligent Quality Renewal Rate)**
- **VRR (Value Renewal Rate)**
- **Late Renewals Tracking**
- **Snapshot-Aligned Contract Categorization**
- **Sales Rep & Partner Attribution**
- **Quarter-over-Quarter Change Indicators**
- **Cancellation Risk Metrics**

All logic was designed independently using mock data and generic SQL views. The model is extensible to integrate with real CRM systems such as Salesforce, HubSpot, or Dynamics 365.
