# Data Warehouse Design for Scalable BI Enablement

**Project Type**: Data Architecture & Modeling  
**Tools**: SQL, Power BI, Excel (Conceptual)

---

## 📘 Overview

This project outlines the layered architecture of a modern data warehouse designed to support scalable, reliable, and business-ready analytics.  
Built using the **Medallion Architecture** pattern, the model separates data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers — allowing traceability, data quality, and consumption-readiness at every stage.

---

## 🧱 Layered Architecture

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw ingestion of unprocessed source data for traceability and debugging.  
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, standardized, and enriched data prepared for analytical use.  
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data models, views, and aggregations used in dashboards and reporting.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Clear separation of concerns for ETL, modeling, and reporting  
- Support for fact/dimension modeling and aggregated views  
- Encapsulation of business logic at the model layer  
- Aligned with Microsoft's best practices for lakehouse and Power BI integration

---

## 🧑‍💼 Use Case

Ideal for **enterprise BI environments** where multiple teams (data engineers, analysts, and business users) require different levels of access and refinement.  
This layered architecture ensures strong **data governance**, **auditability**, and **scalability** of reporting pipelines.
