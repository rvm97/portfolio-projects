## About Me

Strategic BI Analyst with broad international experience across hospitality, finance, CX, ecommerce, and retail operations.  
I specialize in transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights using tools like **Power BI**, **DAX**, and **SQL**. 
My work bridges business operations and analytical strategy — from cleaning and modeling raw data to delivering dashboards that drive real decisions based on what the data is revealing. 

**I bring a modern approach to business intelligence – one that goes far beyond dashboards**
