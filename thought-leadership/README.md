### **Where Data Analysis Ends and Business Intelligence Begins: A Strategic Perspective**

This document explores the distinct but complementary roles of Data Analysis (DA) and Business Intelligence (BI).  
While DA focuses on exploring raw datasets and uncovering patterns, BI translates those insights into structured, decision-ready systems.  
This paper presents a strategic framework for aligning both disciplines to support faster, clearer, and more scalable decision-making in enterprise environments.
